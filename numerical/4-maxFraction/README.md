Given a list of fractions, find the index of the largest one (0-based). It is guaranteed that there are no equal fractions in the input.

Example

For numerators = [5, 2, 5] and denominators = [6, 3, 4], the output should be maxFraction(numerators, denominators) = 2. 
5/4 is the largest fraction, so the answer is 2.
Input/Output

[execution time limit] 0.5 seconds

[input] array.integer numerators

Array of integers representing numerators of the fractions.

Guaranteed constraints:
2 ≤ numerators.length ≤ 10,
1 ≤ numerators[i] ≤ 15.

[input] array.integer denominators

Array of integers of the same length as numerators representing denominators where the ith fraction equals to numerators[i] / denominators[i].

Guaranteed constraints:
denominators.length = numerators.length,
1 ≤ denominators[i] ≤ 15.

[output] integer

0-based index of the largest fraction.
